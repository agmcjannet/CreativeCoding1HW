Command Line Interface deals more with the operating system in the computer while Graphical User Interface is, like the name, using graphics to direct the user though the computer system. GUI shows images, menus, tabs, and leads the user through different icons to their destination. For example, if the user is creating a folder/directory, they will click on a picture of a folder and then use a tab to create a file, and so on. CLI is more precise and exact. It doesn’t use images, only text. It uses commands and code to create things like folders and files on one’s computer. It interacts with the operating system while the Graphical User Interface is more of an application of code and commands for the user that then deals with the operating system separately. When using CLI it is imperative to spell things correctly, while GUI can check spelling and grammar. GUI Is more intuitive for users with its use of pictures, menus, tabs, etc. CLI requires more knowledge of commands, codes, and how the computer system operates. Mistakes are less forgiving and it appears to be more analytical, than visual as it is using only text.
