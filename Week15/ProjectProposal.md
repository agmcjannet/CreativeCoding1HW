## Crossword Project Proposal

I want to work with arrays and create a crossword that you can fill in similar to the New York Times' games app. I want to be able to find an existing crossword as a reference and see how I can fill in clues, allow the user to check their answers, and have placeholders within the text boxes to show what number down or across they are. The NYT games app is the main inspiration for this piece, they have fun features where you can check your answers, the clues, it times the user and I think this will be a fun challenge to apply using arrays, text boxes, web pages and seeing how I can make my code condensed and clean. Learning how to use arrays, different functions that p5js provides, and how to implement skills I learned in HTML into p5js will require extra research. Playing with not only new code, but the aesthetics of the piece will also be a focus. I will be trying to complete this project as early as possible to give myself time to ask for and get help when issues arise. Working on it for at least an hour a day will be essential to finishing on time.
